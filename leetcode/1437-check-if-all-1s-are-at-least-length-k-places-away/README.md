# 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away

Given an array `nums` of `0s` and `1s` and an integer `k`, return `True` if all `1's` are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `False`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`
- `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`
