# 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes itself may be changed.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
