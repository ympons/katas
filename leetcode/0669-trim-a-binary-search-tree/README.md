# 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should **not** change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a **unique answer**.

Return **the root of the trimmed binary search tree**. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
Output: [1,null,2]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- The value of each node in the tree is **unique**.
- `root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
- `0 <= low <= high <= 10^4`
