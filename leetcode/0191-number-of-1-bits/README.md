# 191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of `'1'` bits it has (also known as the *Hamming weight*).

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

**Constraints:**
- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`
