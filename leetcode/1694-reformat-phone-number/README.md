# 1694. Reformat Phone Number

You are given a phone number as a string `number`. `number` consists of digits, spaces `' '`, and/or dashes `'-'`.

You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:

- 2 digits: A single block of length 2.
- 3 digits: A single block of length 3.
- 4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.

The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.

*Return the phone number after formatting.*

**Example 1:**
```
Input: number = "1-23-45 6"
Output: "123-456"
Explanation: The digits are "123456".
Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is "123".
Step 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is "456".
Joining the blocks gives "123-456".
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= number.length <= 100`
- `number` consists of digits and the characters `'-'` and `' '`
- There are at least **two** digits in `number`
