# 845. Longest Mountain in Array

You may recall that an array `arr` is a **mountain array** if and only if:
- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
- - arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
- - arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]

Given an integer array `arr`, *return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain*. Return `0` if there is no mountain subarray.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`
